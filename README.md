# personal-website
My project is my personal website, it is composed of a few main sections!<br>
It consists of the home page, about page, and portfolio page in each of these sections you'll learn more about myself along with some pictures.<br>

For the technological part of my website I started with a blank file in vscode and worked from there. I used html to format and css to make my website more decorative, I also tried to add some javascript but I had more difficulty with that. I also made a repository through github for my website.<br>

The major challenge I faced was creating my naviation bar I tried to look back on notes and did some google searching and work from that but my navigation bar was not coming along properly. After a while I did a youtube search and found this very helpful tutorial that guided me through the process. Along with my navigation bar I was not able to remove the text decoration from my page links, I couldnt even add color or remove the text decoration. I tired a looking back on notes, and googling it but all of the options did nothing.<br> 
I do want to improve my website a lot in the future, I want to get more confident when adding javascript and more knowledge in coding. I want my website to be really pretty and organized.

These are the pages and links that helped me out!!<br>
